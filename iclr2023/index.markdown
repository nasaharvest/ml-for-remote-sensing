# Machine Learning for Remote Sensing
Remote sensing data (also referred to as Earth observation or satellite data) has become an increasingly popular modality for machine learning research. This interest has largely been driven by the opportunities that remote sensing data present for contributing to challenges urgently important to society, such as climate change, food security, conservation, disasters, and poverty. This growing interest in ML research for remote sensing data is also driven by the challenges presented by its unique characteristics compared to other data modalities (e.g., images, text, video). Remote sensing datasets are very high-dimensional and often have spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions more complex than traditional RGB images or videos. The diversity of instruments used for observing the Earth at different wavelengths, temporal cadences, and spatial resolutions has driven active research in domain adaptation, data fusion, and other topic areas. In this workshop, we aim to stimulate and highlight research on new methods, datasets, and systems for machine learning for remote sensing data and especially encourage submissions and discussions about research in the African context.

## Call for Papers
**Important Dates**
- ~~Submission Deadline - February 05, 2023 (11:59 pm AoE)~~
- ~~Acceptance Notification - March 03, 2023~~
- Workshop - May 05, 2023

**Topics Covered**

The goal of this workshop is to solicit research papers addressing advancements in the following topics as well as other relevant topics in Machine Learning for Remote Sensing:
- Domain adaptation
- Concept drift and out of distribution detection
- Evaluation using unlabeled data
- Model architectures for remote sensing data
- Semi-supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Multi-fidelity data fusion
- Human in the loop and active-learning
- Machine learning for time series
- Methods for learning from limited labeled data (e.g., low-shot learning, meta-learning)
- New benchmark datasets involving remote sensing data
- Geographic equity
- Solutions specific to the African context
- Applications related to sustainable development, societal needs, planetary exploration, and more including but not limited to agriculture and food security, forestry, biodiversity and species distribution modeling, and natural hazards and disasters (e.g., landslides).

We will solicit two types of papers: short proposal papers (3 pages) and short papers describing new and ongoing/in progress research (4 pages). Page limits do not include references, which are unlimited. Papers will be non-archival. To prepare your submission, please use the [LaTeX style files for ICLR 2023](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2023.zip). Paper reviews will be double blind. When submitting your manuscript, make sure you do not include any personally-identifying information such as author names or Github links which would de-anonymize the submission.

Machine Learning for Remote Sensing is non-archival and thus dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties.
