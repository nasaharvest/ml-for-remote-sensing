# Machine Learning for Remote Sensing

This workshop promotes trans-disciplinary research through diverse view-points to tackle the pressing questions of our times, such as climate change, social inequalities, biodiversity, and food security.
Developing modern machine learning approaches tailored towards remote sensing data is key to investigating these problems efficiently. This third Machine Learning for Remote Sensing (ML4RS) workshop promotes this exchange by allowing researchers to present their research on environmentally and societally important applications and/or  innovative methods that can have an impact in such application domains.

### Topics

We solicit research papers addressing advancements in key topics in Machine Learning for Remote Sensing, such as **domain adaptation**, **concept drift**, **out-of-distribution detection**, **evaluation using unlabeled data**, **model architectures for remote sensing data**, **semi-supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, **self-supervised learning**, **multi-fidelity data fusion**, **federated learning**, **data-centric AI**, **human-in-the-loop** and **active learning**, machine learning for **time series**, methods for **learning from limited labeled data** (e.g., few-shot learning, meta-learning), new **benchmark datasets** involving remote sensing data, **geographic equity**, and **fairness**.

We welcome applications related to **sustainable development**, **societal needs**, **planetary exploration**, and **more**, including but not limited to **agriculture** and **food security**, **forestry**, **biodiversity** and **species distribution modeling**, **natural hazards** and **disasters**, and other societal and environmental questions.

Papers can present methodological innovations designed towards a particular problem or can also apply existing methods when they highlight new perspectives or limitations on existing methods or the broader environmental and societal applicability through a particular dataset or impact area.

### Bonus Track

We invite content for a "bonus track" of our workshop to better broadcast projects, progress, and announcements across the diverse orbits of work on machine learning for remote sensing. In particular we welcome the submission of one-slide presentations and live demos.

- **Bonus track submission form:** [https://forms.gle/jPqYbQPgAhTi7RXA6](https://forms.gle/jPqYbQPgAhTi7RXA6)

The deadline for the bonus track is April 23, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth).

Accepted slides will be auto-played during the poster sessions and breaks and linked from the workshop site. Demos will be presented _in-person_ during the event subject to venue space and equipment.

### Travel Support
Thanks to our sponsors, we have limited funding available to support the travel of students to attend the workshop held at ICLR 2024. Awards are based on merit with additional consideration based on need and travel distance. Priority will be given to those whose papers are accepted for presentation at the workshop.

The deadline for submitting this application was March 28th, 11:59pm Anywhere on Earth.

### Paper Format

This year, we have two tracks:

1. a workshop paper track (4-pages) and
2. a [tiny paper](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers) track (2-pages)

Please indicate the track in the submission form.

#### Workshop Paper Track

We invite short papers describing new and ongoing/in progress research of **4 pages**. To prepare your submission, please use the [LaTeX style files for the ML4RS workshop ICLR 2025](https://www.overleaf.com/read/srnfvcbwrqgt#4f7e09) that provides further detail on the paper structure. Paper reviews will be **double blind**. When submitting your manuscript, make sure you do not include any personally-identifying information such as author names or GitHub links which would de-anonymize the submission.

Page limits do not include references, which are unlimited. The workshop papers will be **non-archival** and dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties. After the workshop selected papers will be invited to submit to a special stream in the [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8859) (please note that this will incur a - fast - additional review phase and additional publication fees).

Machine Learning for Remote Sensing is non-archival and thus dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties.

#### Tiny Paper Track

Following the [ICLR 2023](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForTinyPapers) and [2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForTinyPapers) initiatives, we are delighted to implement Tiny Papers in the workshop as part of the DEI initiative at [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers)!

The objectives of the ‚ÄúTiny Papers‚Äù track at ICLR workshops are threefold:
* Creating alternative, complementary, and diverse entry points to research. And in particular, creating approachable avenues for beginners to enter and enjoy the ICLR community.
* Celebrating intermediate breakthroughs in machine learning.
* Efficiently disseminating ideas, findings, and opinions.

Despite the wide range of topics that could benefit from the Tiny Papers format, we focus the type of submissions to be the following:
* An implementation and experimentation of a novel (not published elsewhere) yet simple idea, or a modest and self-contained theoretical result
* A follow-up experiment to or re-analysis of a previously published paper
* A new perspective on a previously published paper

The guidelines and restrictions for this Tiny Papers track are:

Write a paper with the same structure as seen in full papers, but with at most 2 pages of main text. References, Appendices do not count towards the page limit, but we do not recommend dissecting a regular length paper into a tiny paper by moving the majority of the content into appendices. It is recommended to have 1-2 figures, 1 table, and 4-5 sections. But authors are free to use their own structure.

### Paper Submission

Please submit your paper before the deadline (see important dates!) via CMT.

- **Submission site:** [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4RS2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4RS2025)

You can still edit your submission until the deadline. You can also choose to submit a supplementary pdf alongside the 4-page paper. However, the reviewers are not required to look at the supplementary files.
